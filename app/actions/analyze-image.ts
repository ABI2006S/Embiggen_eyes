The image "${imageTitle}" shows multiple geological features including impact craters of varying sizes and preserved ejecta patterns. The surface appears to be primarily composed of rocky material with minimal signs of recent geological activity. Notable features include complex crater morphology, ridge formations, and evidence of multiple impact events.`
